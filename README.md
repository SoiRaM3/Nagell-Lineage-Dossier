# Nagell Family – Documentary Lineage Notes

This repository provides a concise, source-based overview of the **Nagell** family,
a medieval armigerous lineage attested in Norway by the mid-15th century.

The purpose of this repository is **documentary placement**.
It does not assert legal, noble, social, or chivalric status, nor does it make
claims of authority, rank, or privilege.

## Scope and Intent

This project exists to:

- Place the Nagell family accurately within the historical record  
- Summarize known documentary evidence in a neutral format  
- Provide a stable reference point for future historical or genealogical research  

It does **not** attempt to:
- revive legal or social status  
- claim modern nobility or chivalric authority  
- construct a complete or exhaustive genealogy  

All statements are limited to available documentation and are open to revision
if new sources emerge.
