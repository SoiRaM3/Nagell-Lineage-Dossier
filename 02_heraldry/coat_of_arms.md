## General Description

The Nagell coat of arms is characterized by a **canting design**, featuring
**three nails** as its primary charge.

Canting arms were a common medieval heraldic practice, visually encoding a
family name or identity through symbolic representation.

## Heraldic Elements

While exact blazon formulations may vary across sources, the core elements are
consistent:

- **Charge:** Three nails  
- **Arrangement:** Typically grouped or ordered symmetrically  
- **Function:** Canting reference to the family name (*Nagell* / *nagel*)  

The arms function as an identifying mark of lineage rather than as an
indication of hierarchical rank.

## Heraldic Context

In the medieval Scandinavian context, coats of arms were used by a range of
armigerous families, including:

- lower nobility  
- knightly households  
- established armigerous lineages without formal titles  

The presence of a stable coat of arms indicates recognition of family identity
within this social framework.

## Use and Interpretation

Within this repository, the Nagell coat of arms is treated as:

- evidence of armigerous status  
- a marker of lineage continuity  
- a historical identifier  

It is not presented as a claim to modern heraldic rights, noble recognition, or
exclusive symbolic authority.
