# Nagell – Armorial Attestations

This document summarizes known and referenced **armorial attestations** of the
Nagell coat of arms.

It is intended as a guide to documentary presence rather than an exhaustive
armorial catalogue.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to:

- note the existence of armorial references  
- establish chronological plausibility  
- indicate avenues for further source verification  

---

## Early Attestation

The Nagell family is attested as armigerous in Norway by **1445**, placing the
coat of arms within the medieval heraldic tradition of Scandinavia.

This attestation indicates recognized use of heraldic symbols at a time when
such usage was restricted to established armigerous lineages.

## Types of Armorial Evidence

Armorial presence may be reflected in:

- seals  
- armorial manuscripts  
- heraldic compilations  
- secondary genealogical works referencing earlier material  

Not all forms survive directly; some are known through later citations.

---

## Source Characteristics

Existing references suggest:

- consistent association of the three-nail motif with the Nagell name  
- stability of the heraldic identity over time  
- alignment between name, symbol, and lineage  

This consistency supports the interpretation of deliberate heraldic usage.

## Limits of Current Evidence

This document does not:
- claim a complete list of all armorial appearances  
- assert uninterrupted physical survival of all heraldic artifacts  
- reconstruct undocumented visual details  

It reflects the current state of accessible documentation.

## Research Notes

Further confirmation may be sought in:

- medieval Scandinavian armorials  
- seal catalogues  
- regional archival collections  
- comparative heraldic studies  

These avenues are noted for future research but are not asserted here.

## Revision Note

This document may be expanded if specific armorial sources are identified and
verified, including dated manuscripts or seal impressions.
