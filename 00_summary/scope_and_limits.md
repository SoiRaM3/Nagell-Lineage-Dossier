# Scope and Limits

This document defines the **scope, intent, and limitations** of the Nagell
lineage dossier.

Its purpose is to clarify what this repository does and does not attempt to do,
and to prevent misinterpretation of its contents.

---

## Scope of This Repository

This repository is limited to:

- documentary placement of the Nagell family in the historical record  
- summary of available evidence regarding lineage, heraldry, and continuity  
- contextual explanation of social and institutional roles  
- transparent handling of uncertainty and gaps  

The material is presented for historical and genealogical reference only.

---

## What This Repository Does Not Do

This repository does **not**:

- assert legal, noble, or chivalric status  
- claim authority, representation, or custodianship  
- revive or establish orders, ranks, or titles  
- construct a complete or exhaustive genealogy  
- speculate beyond available documentation  

No part of this repository should be interpreted as a claim of social position
or inherited authority in the present.

---

## Interpretive Restraint

Interpretations are intentionally conservative.

Where documentation is incomplete:
- uncertainty is stated explicitly  
- conjecture is avoided  
- silence in the record is not filled by narrative  

Context is used to frame evidence, not to replace it.

---

## Temporal Limits

This repository focuses primarily on:

- medieval attestation and identity  
- early modern continuity and adaptation  
- surname transmission and termination  

Modern individuals and private family narratives are outside its scope.

---

## Terminology Use

Terminology is employed descriptively and historically, not honorifically.

Words such as *armigerous*, *lineage*, and *service* are used in their historical
sense and do not imply modern legal or social status.

---

## Revision Boundaries

Future revisions are limited to:
- correction of factual errors  
- incorporation of new documentary evidence  
- clarification of existing interpretations  

Revisions will not expand the scope beyond documentary and contextual history.

---

## Closing Statement

This repository exists to **place**, not to perform.

By defining clear limits, it preserves the integrity of the historical record
and ensures that the Nagell lineage is represented accurately, without
assertion or embellishment.
