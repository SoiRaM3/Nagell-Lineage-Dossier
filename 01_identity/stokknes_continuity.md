For clarity:

- **Name-bearer** refers solely to documented use of the surname

  records and may change with new evidence

Surname termination is a common outcome in medieval and early modern European
lineages and does not imply historical failure, loss of status, or erasure.

This document treats termination as a descriptive fact, not a narrative event.

## Revision Policy

If new sources emerge demonstrating continued independent use of the Nagell
surname beyond the currently known endpoint, this document will be updated
accordingly.

Until such evidence appears, this statement represents the best-supported
summary of the available record.
