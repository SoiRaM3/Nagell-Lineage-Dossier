# Genealogical Method

This document outlines the **methodological principles** used in compiling and
interpreting genealogical and historical information related to the Nagell
family.

The approach prioritizes documentary evidence, transparency, and restraint.

---

## General Approach

Research presented in this repository follows a **document-first methodology**.
Assertions are made only where supported by identifiable sources or well-
established historical context.

The method emphasizes:
- source proximity (contemporary over retrospective)
- consistency across independent records
- cautious interpretation of incomplete material

## Source Hierarchy

Sources are evaluated according to the following general hierarchy:

1. Contemporary primary records (e.g., seals, parish registers, official records)
2. Near-contemporary compilations or copies
3. Later secondary works referencing earlier material
4. Contextual historical analysis used only to frame, not prove, conclusions

Later genealogical summaries are treated as interpretive aids rather than
authoritative sources unless corroborated.

## Name and Identity Linking

Individuals are linked across records only when supported by:
- consistent naming patterns
- chronological plausibility
- geographic continuity
- associated roles or functions

Shared surnames or similar spellings alone are not treated as proof of identity.

## Heraldic Evidence

Heraldic material is treated as **identity evidence**, not proof of rank or
legal status.

Armorial references are interpreted cautiously, with attention to:
- period usage norms
- regional practice
- consistency of motif and association

---

## Negative Evidence

The absence of documentation is not treated as evidence of non-existence.
Conversely, silence in the record is not filled by conjecture.

Where documentation ends, interpretation also ends.

---

## Scope Control

This repository does not attempt:
- exhaustive genealogical reconstruction
- resolution of all disputed links
- harmonization of conflicting traditions without evidence

Methodological restraint is treated as a strength rather than a limitation.

## Revision Note

Methodological principles may be refined if new categories of source material
become relevant or if clearer standards are required.
