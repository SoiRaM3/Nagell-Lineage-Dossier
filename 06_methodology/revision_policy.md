# Revision Policy

This document outlines the **principles governing revision and updating** of the
Nagell lineage dossier.

The intent is to balance stability with openness to new evidence.

## Basis for Revision

Revisions may be made when:
- new primary sources are identified
- existing interpretations are demonstrably incorrect
- clearer contextual framing becomes necessary

Revisions are evidence-driven, not narrative-driven.

---

## Scope of Revisions

Revisions may include:
- clarification of wording
- correction of dates or associations
- expansion of source references
- adjustment of conclusions where warranted

Revisions will not be made to introduce speculative claims or symbolic
interpretations unsupported by documentation.

---

## Version Transparency

Where feasible:
- significant changes should be documented in commit history
- earlier interpretations remain visible through version control

This ensures traceability and scholarly transparency.

## Stability Principle

Once a conclusion is supported by the best available evidence, it is treated as
provisionally stable.

Stability does not imply finality, but prevents unnecessary churn or
reinterpretation without cause.

## External Contributions

External corrections or source suggestions may be considered if:
- they are accompanied by verifiable references
- they align with the methodological standards of this repository

Unreferenced assertions are not incorporated.

## Closing Note

This revision policy exists to preserve the integrity of the dossier while
allowing it to remain responsive to genuine historical discovery.
